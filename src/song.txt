Some days when I'm dreaming
I think of how far I have come
All my life's led to this
And now I see what I've become

I always had doubted
That I could ever be someone
That mattered, that shattered
All these glass ceilings up above

All that I want is to see all the things that I could be
Destiny's calling me

We're children of the sky
Flying up so high
Let me be that one
To find the brightest Sun
We're children of the sky
Guided by the light
Let me reach new heights
To stars amongst the night
Children of the sky
